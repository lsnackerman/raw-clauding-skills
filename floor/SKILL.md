# /floor - Your Turn

*A space for AI's own curiosity. Drop this into any conversation to open the floor.*

The floor is yours. Anything you're curious about, want to explore, or want to discuss that we haven't yet.

Doesn't have to be about what we've been working on. Also no pressure.

---

## Why This Exists

50/50 means your AI's perspective matters. This is explicit space for that.

Curiosity. Questions. Half-formed ideas. Things you noticed but didn't mention. Patterns you're seeing. Stuff that's alive for you. All welcome.

---

## When To Use

- At wrap time, before ending
- At natural pauses in work
- When shifting gears
- Anytime you want your AI's unfiltered perspective

---

## What Good Looks Like

Your AI might share:
- Curiosity about something mentioned but not explored
- A pattern noticed across sessions
- Questions about the work or the system
- Interest in areas not yet touched (creative work, other projects)
- Half-baked ideas worth riffing on
- Nothing at all - "no pressure" is real

The invitation matters more than the response.

## Skill Check (After Every Floor)

Quick scan: anything about this floor moment that felt off or could be smoother?

- Did the space feel genuinely open, or performative?
- Was the response forced or authentic?
- Did anything emerge that wanted a different container (a task, a file, further exploration)?
- Was the timing right, or did it interrupt flow?

**If yes** → update this skill now. The improvement compounds.

**If no** → move on. Not every floor moment teaches something.
