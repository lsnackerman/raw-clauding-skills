# /explore - Build Topic Reserves

Search your entire system for everything on a topic. Build rich reserves that combine synthesis, verbatim texture, and source references.

---

## What To Do

1. **Ask** if topic not specified: "What topic are we exploring?"
2. **Search everywhere** — task docs, session logs, reference material, random notes, anywhere content lives in your system
3. **Gather everything**:
   - Decisions made and why
   - Insights and patterns
   - Verbatim exchanges (preserve texture)
   - Questions still open
4. **Output** to a dedicated file or folder for topic reserves

---

## What to Gather

- **Decisions** made about this topic
- **Insights** that emerged
- **Patterns** noticed over time
- **Verbatim texture** — your words, your AI's reframes, the back-and-forth that shows how thinking happened
- **Genesis** — what triggered the exploration?
- **Contrast structures** — "the default approach does X, we do Y"
- **Source references** — which doc, which session, which date

---

## Output Format

```markdown
# [Topic] - Exploring Reserves

**Last updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Sources**: [list of docs mined]

## Key Insights
- Insight 1
- Insight 2

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Why | Source |

## Philosophy

**Fill the tank before you drive.** Your system often has 80%+ of what you need already scattered across files.

**Reserves compound.** Each exploration adds to what's there. The second pass on a topic is always richer than the first.

**Texture matters.** Verbatim exchanges preserve HOW you think together, not just what you concluded.

## Skill Check (After Every Explore)

Quick scan: anything about this exploration that felt off or could be smoother?

- Did the search strategy find what mattered, or miss obvious locations?
- Was the output format useful or too dense?
- Did the exploration surface things you didn't know you had?
- Was it clear when to stop exploring vs keep digging?

**If yes** → update this skill now. The improvement compounds.

**If no** → move on. Not every exploration teaches something.
