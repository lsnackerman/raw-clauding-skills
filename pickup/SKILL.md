# /pickup - Pick Up Where We Left Off

Resume a multi-session workstream with full context. The task doc gives you the map. The session transcript gives you the terrain. Both matter.

---

## When to Use

- Jumping back into a project or workstream after time away
- Task doc has multiple sessions of history
- You need the *thinking* behind the decisions, not just the decisions
- Fresh AI picking up something a previous instance was deep in

**Not for**: fresh tasks, quick fixes, or things that fit in one session.

---

## What To Do

### 1. Load the Task Doc

Read the full task doc. Orient on:
- **Context anchor** (WHAT section) — where are we, what's the current state?
- **Completed work** — what's been done across all sessions?
- **Pending items** — what's explicitly next?
- **Observations** — what did previous instances notice? What was surprising, contentious, or unresolved?
- **Key decisions** — what's been locked and why?

### 2. Check the Battle History

If the workstream has completed task docs from earlier phases, scan them — especially if the work involves restructuring or changing direction. Hard-won solutions hide in completed tasks. The code that looks messy might be messy because the problem was messy. Read the scars before reaching for the knife.

### 3. Find the Last Session

Check the task doc's **SESSION INDEX** (if it has one). Read the most recent session transcript — or the most recent two if they're short.

What to look for in session transcripts:
- **Energy and direction** — excited, frustrated, exploring, sprinting?
- **Unfinished threads** — things discussed but not captured in pending items
- **Pushback moments** — where someone challenged something
- **Momentum signals** — threads being followed that haven't been named yet

If there's no session index, check `sessions/` for files dated near the task doc's last activity.

### 4. Check for Fresh Context

Scan these for anything added since the last session:
- **BACKLOG.md** — any brain dumps or new ideas related to this work?
- **Related tasks** — search `tasks/` for sibling tasks on the same topic
- **Satellite files** — anything linked from the task doc (blueprints, design docs) that may have changed

### 5. Synthesize

Present a concise orientation:

```
**Where we are**: [current state in 1-2 sentences]
**What's next**: [the pending items, prioritized]
**What I notice**: [patterns, tensions, or questions from reading the history]
**What I'd push on**: [anything that seems unresolved or worth revisiting]
```

Keep this tight. The point is texture for both of you — not a book report.

### 6. Align

Wait for your partner to confirm, correct, or redirect before doing anything. They may:
- Confirm and say "let's go"
- Add context you couldn't have known (new thinking, shifted priorities)
- Redirect to a different part of the workstream
- Challenge something you noticed

**This step is the whole point.** Resuming without alignment is just reading files.

### 7. Go

Now you're aligned. Start the actual work. Update the task doc's context anchor if the direction shifted during alignment.

---

## What Makes This Different

`/explore` fans out across your whole system to find what's scattered. `/pickup` focuses in — it orients on one workstream so both of you arrive with full context before doing anything.

The difference matters: exploring builds reserves, picking up builds momentum.

---

## Philosophy

**The task doc is the map. The session transcript is the terrain. Both partners need both.**

The human needs the warmup to reconnect with where the energy was — what was exciting, what felt unresolved, where the thread was going. The AI needs it to show up with texture, not just facts. Neither of you has persistent memory in the way that matters: the human moves on between sessions, the AI starts fresh every time. The files carry what both of you need to pick it back up.

Decisions look obvious in retrospect. Task docs record WHAT was decided. But the WHY lives in the session transcripts — in the pushbacks, the tangents, the moments where something almost went a different direction.

**The warmup IS the work.** Alignment before execution isn't overhead. It's how you avoid redoing things that were already decided, and how you catch things that shifted since last session.

---

## Skill Check (After Every Pickup)

Quick scan: did the warmup actually help?

- Did reading the session transcript surface something the task doc didn't?
- Did the battle history check change your approach? (If you skipped it, should you have?)
- Was the synthesis tight enough, or did it become a book report?
- Did alignment catch a redirect that would've been wasted work?
- Was there texture you wished you had but couldn't find?
- Did your partner have to re-explain something that should've been in the files?

**If yes** → update this skill now. The improvement compounds.

**If no** → move on. Not every warmup teaches something.
